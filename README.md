# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING K-MEANS

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook is part of a customer segmentation project that focuses on clustering and analyzing customers based on a dataset obtained from a shopping mall. The dataset comprises valuable information about the mall's customers, including their age, annual income, spending score, unique identifiers, and gender.

## K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups or clusters based on their similarity. It is widely used in various fields, including customer segmentation, image compression, and data analysis.

## Dataset Overview
CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Customer gender (Male or Female).
Age: Customer age.
Annual Income (k$): Customer annual income in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score reflecting customer spending behavior and habits.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this analysis is to employ K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their attributes and behavior. By effectively segmenting customers, we aim to gain valuable insights into their preferences and habits. These insights can be leveraged to tailor marketing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing business operations.

## Notebook Highlights

Throughout this Jupyter notebook, we will undertake the following tasks:

1. Explore the dataset and perform essential data preprocessing.
2. Apply the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
3. Visualize the resulting clusters and analyze their unique characteristics.
4. Determine the optimal number of clusters using various methods, ensuring the accuracy of our segmentation.
5. Employ Hierarchical Clustering to perform additional segmentation, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for mall management and marketing teams. By understanding customer segments better through K-Means Clustering, the project aims to enhance customer engagement and improve overall business performance.

Feel free to navigate through the Jupyter notebook to explore the details of each step in our customer segmentation project.
