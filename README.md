# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING K-MEANS & DECISION TREE

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook is part of a customer segmentation project that focuses on clustering and analyzing customers based on a dataset obtained from a shopping mall. The dataset comprises valuable information about the mall's customers, including their age, annual income, spending score, unique identifiers, and gender.

## K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups or clusters based on their similarity. It is widely used in various fields, including customer segmentation, image compression, and data analysis.

## Decision Tree Algorithm
The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It creates a tree-like model where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the final predicted outcome (class label or numerical value). The algorithm recursively selects features and splits data to create decision rules, making it a interpretable and widely used method in machine learning.

## Dataset Overview
CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Customer gender (Male or Female).
Age: Customer age.
Annual Income (k$): Customer annual income in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score reflecting customer spending behavior and habits.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this analysis is to employ both K-Means Clustering and Decision Tree techniques to segment customers based on their attributes and behavior. By effectively segmenting customers using these two methods, we aim to gain valuable insights into their preferences and habits. These insights can be leveraged to tailor marketing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing business operations.

## Notebook Highlights

Throughout this Jupyter notebook, we will undertake the following tasks:

1. Explore the dataset and perform essential data preprocessing.
2. Apply the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
3. Utilize Decision Tree analysis to further refine customer segmentation and uncover underlying patterns.
4. Visualize the resulting clusters and decision tree analysis results to analyze their unique characteristics.
5. Determine the optimal number of clusters using various methods, ensuring the accuracy of our segmentation in K-Means Clustering.
6. Employ Hierarchical Clustering to perform additional segmentation, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
   
This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for mall management and marketing teams. By combining K-Means Clustering and Decision Tree techniques for customer segmentation, the project aims to enhance customer engagement and improve overall business performance.

Feel free to navigate through the Jupyter notebook to explore the details of each step in our customer segmentation project, which combines K-Means Clustering and Decision Tree analysis for comprehensive insights.
